Table Name: 'transaction'

| driver_name |   balance   | amount_paid |
|-------------|:-----------:|------------:|
| John Doe    |      389    |   200       |
| John Doe    |      389    |   200       |
| John Doe    |      389    |   200       |
| John Doe    |      389    |   200       |

**Database**

Problem description:
  We have two driver objects created with a Driver class. Each driver is a customer in our company.
  The drivers are able to send payments to us through their bank account but we don't have an ID for their bank account on record so we don't know which of them is sending us what money.
  
  If the two drivers send payments to us, with an optional memo field,
  how do we handle matching the payments to the right driver?
  Please describe why you arrived at your solution.
